        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this project is to develop a Python app that can analyze sales data of the food industry stored in a remote database. The app provides both visual and numeric analysis of the data and offers a user-friendly interface for accessing and analyzing the data directly from the remote database.</p>

        <h2>Libraries and APIs Used</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>oauth2client module to authorize the user to the Google database</li>
          <li>Google Drive API and Google Sheets API to create a link between the user and the Google Sheet</li>
          <li>gspread module to access the sales data from the remote database</li>
          <li>NumPy to perform numerical analysis on the data</li>
          <li>Matplotlib to create graphs and visualizations of the data</li>
          <li>Requests library, Python Image Library (PIL), and Input/Output (io) library for GUI enhancement and data handling</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Features Offered</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>User-friendly interface for accessing and analyzing sales data: Users can access the sales data directly from the remote database through a GUI interface and choose between visual or numeric analysis of the data.</li>
          <li>Visual analysis of sales data: The app uses Matplotlib to create various graphs and visualizations of the sales data according to the parameters selected by the user.</li>
          <li>Numeric analysis of sales data: The app uses NumPy to perform numerical analysis of the sales data, such as calculating the mean, median, mode, or standard deviation of the data.</li>
          <li>AI-based suggestions for analysis: The app is integrated with AI to provide suggestions based on the analysis of the sales data to enhance production and sales.</li>
          <li>Data export: The app allows users to export the analyzed data in various formats, such as graphs (JPG, JPEG, PNG) and selected data (CSV, Excel).</li>
        </ol>
      </section>
