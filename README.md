    <h1>Meal Metrics</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this project is to develop a Python app that can analyze the sales data of the food industry, stored in Remote Database. The app provides both visual and numeric analysis of the data and offers a GUI interface for users to access and analyze the data directly from Remote Database without any delays.</p>
    <h2><b>Libraries and APIs Used</b></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>oauth2client</b> module to authorize the user to the Google Database</li>
      <li><b>Google Drive API</b> and <b>Google Sheets API</b> to create a link between the user and the Google Sheet</li>
      <li><b>gspread</b> module to access the sales data from the Remote Database</li>
      <li><b>NumPy</b> to perform numerical analysis on the data</li>
      <li><b>Matplotlib</b> to create graphs and visualizations of the data</li>
      <li><b>requests</b> library, <b>Python Image Library (PIL)</b>, and <b>Input/Output(io)</b> library for GUI enhancement and data handling.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><b>Features Offered</b></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>GUI interface for accessing and analyzing sales data: Users can access the sales data directly from Remote Database through a GUI interface, and choose between visual or numeric analysis of the data.</li>
      <li>Visual analysis of sales data: The app uses <b>Matplotlib</b> to create graphs and visualizations of the sales data, such as bar charts, histograms, etc according to the parameters selected by the user.</li>
      <li>Numeric analysis of sales data: The app uses <b>NumPy</b> to perform numerical analysis of the sales data, such as calculating the mean, median, mode, or standard deviation of the data.</li>
      <li>AI-Based Suggestions of Analysis: The app is integrated with AI to provide suggestions based on the analysis of the sales data to enhance production and sales.</li>
      <li>Data export: The app will allow users to export the analyzed data in various formats, such as:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Graphs: JPG, JPEG, PNG.</li>
        <li>Selected Data: CSV, Excel.</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>The expected output of the app will be either of these:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A graph plotted on given parameters</li>
      <li>Numeric data according to the analysis</li>
      <li>Some quick suggestions based on the analysis</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Users can use this output to gain insights into the sales data of the food industry</p>
    <p>Overall, the Meal Metrics App provides a user-friendly interface for accessing and analyzing sales data stored in Remote Database and offers a range of analytical tools for visualizing and interpreting the data.</p>
